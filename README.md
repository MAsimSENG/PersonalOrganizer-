# PersonalOrganizer
This is a project I am working on with the aim of making my planning and organizing of time easier. Currently it is a simple todo list that allows you to add items, remove a single item or all the items in the list. It uses localStorage provided by the web-browser. 

I plan to add the following features: 

* Organize the list items into specific cateogries:
  
    ex: if list item is : study for midterm, it should be grouped with other list items that are associated with studying for midterms. 
    
* add a priority functionality based on time left before it should be done and its importance 

* create a table on the page that mentions the prayer times for the specific day.

* add visualization 

+more!
